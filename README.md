# GoogleImageSearchAPISimulation
a Google Image Search API Simulation while Googleâ€˜s is no longer available.

webspider.py is the API which simulates the Google API and return a json-like string just like Google did.

main.py import webspider and read the json result.

I use main.py to query all the lines in "***.txt" in which each line contain a query for Google Image Search
then download 20 images in every query's result.
